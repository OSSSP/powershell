post-exploitation scripts

two scripts that will help a bit post-exploitation.

dropscan, will scan for folders, which could contain sensitive files, like passwords, and accounts.
scanpass, will scan for passwords in cleartext files, and report back for files with specific filenames.

Obviously it's typical that these scripts require the following
Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

If you have suggestions for file extensions or any other things don't hesitate.
